Reload Mechanism
=====

!!! note

    This page is a work in progress.


> Below are the instructions to add an automatic reload mechanism to the CyberRunner robot. The reload mechanism uses a light sensor to detect when the marble is ready to be reset to the beginning. A solenoid then launches the ball through a tube path back to the start.

## List of Components
* Solenoid
* Arduino
* Light Sensor
* Wiring
* Screws, bolts
* Solenoid holder (3D printed)
* Y x Tubes, tube connectors
* Arduino etc. holders

### Suggested Tools
* Hot glue gun :)

## Building the Reload Mechanism


## Configuring the Electronics
(Code needs to be loaded and start running on the arduino)

## Reloading with the CyberRunner
(This regards connections to the computer/usb hub)
